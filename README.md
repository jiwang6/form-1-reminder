# BullBot
The original GroupMe bot for form-1 reminders, boxed lunch reminders, and mitch's menus. More functionality coming soon <sup>tm</sup>.

## Bot Functionality 
Typing /meals in the upper 3 gc will send a spreadsheet for the meals of every month.

## Scheduled Scripting
At 2100 everyday, the server will send two reminders: sign the form 1 and like for boxed lunches.

## Future Ideas
### Doolie bot
Says the meals of the day, days until major events, the UOD, etc.

### BullBot 1.1
Additional commands and responses. Will have some sort of assignment reminders, potentially CE Quizzes.

### EudaimoniaBot
Full spectrum automation and reminder functionality. Can call bot to save events, will remind based on a Google calendar, can take polls, etc.
